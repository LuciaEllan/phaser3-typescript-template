# Phaser 3 project template for TypeScript
A bare minimum project template for Phaser 3 with TypeScript.
This is based on [this Medium article by digitsensitive](https://medium.com/@digit.sensitivee/learn-to-create-a-html5-game-in-5-minutes-604118f5d0ab). I removed the game code from it, and made slight changes on run commands to use local webpack instead of globally installed one.

## Initialize the template
```
npm install
```

## Build and run
You may use `npm run dev` or `npm run build`
